```
 gradle bootJar

 docker build -t willywonkafactory .  
 
 docker run -p 8081:8081 -d --net="host" -it willywonkafactory
```

### Run tests

To test the boot jar you must have a mongodb installed on your computer.
In the root of the project run:

```
 gradle test
```


### Swagger

Once the application is started with docker-compose it can be tested with swagger:

[http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html)
